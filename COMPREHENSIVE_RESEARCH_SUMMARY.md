3. **Perfect Isolation**: Zero cross-tenant leakage across 1,500 total queries (500 per DB) confirms all three databases are production-ready for SaaS applications

4. **Memory Efficiency**: Weaviate uses 26% less memory than ChromaDB and 18% less than Qdrant in multi-tenant scenarios

5. **Scalability Implications**:

   - **50 tenants ‚Üí 500 queries**: No degradation in isolation
   - **25,000 total records**: Efficient handling across all databases
   - **Linear scaling**: Insertion time scales linearly with tenant count

6. **Architecture Insights**:
   - **Qdrant**: Separate collections provide good isolation but slower insertion
   - **Weaviate**: Native multi-tenancy (tenant filter) optimizes queries
   - **ChromaDB**: Collection-per-tenant simple but effective

**Description**: Dual bar chart showing (a) records/second throughput and (b) total ingestion time for 50,500 records. Weaviate achieves 1,417 rec/s, 45% faster than Qdrant.

### Figure 2: Query Latency Comparison

![Query Latency](results/paper_figures/figure2_query_latency.png)

**Description**: Bar chart with error bars showing average query latency (100 queries) with min/max range. Weaviate averages 6.71ms, 48% faster than Qdrant.

### Figure 3: Precision vs Recall Trade-off

![Precision vs Recall](results/paper_figures/figure3_precision_recall.png)

**Description**: Scatter plot revealing accuracy trade-offs. Qdrant leads in both metrics (14.9% precision, 38.3% recall), while Weaviate prioritizes speed over accuracy.

### Figure 4: Multi-Tenant Performance Overhead

![Multi-Tenant Overhead](results/paper_figures/figure4_multitenant_overhead.png)

**Description**: Dual chart showing (a) query latency overhead percentage vs single-tenant baseline and (b) average insertion time per tenant. Surprisingly, all databases show negative overhead (improved performance).

### Figure 5: Comprehensive Comparison Dashboard

![Comprehensive Comparison](results/paper_figures/figure5_comprehensive_comparison.png)

**Description**: Six-panel dashboard comparing all metrics: ingestion throughput, query latency, precision, recall, multi-tenant latency, and cross-tenant isolation. Provides complete at-a-glance comparison.

### Figure 6: Query Latency Distribution

![Latency Distribution](results/paper_figures/figure6_latency_distribution.png)

**Description**: Box plots showing latency distribution across 100 queries per database. Demonstrates Weaviate's consistency (low variance) and ChromaDB's higher median latency.
