## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Update: Fair Benchmarking

### Issue Identified

Initial benchmarks showed Weaviate significantly faster than Qdrant, which contradicted many industry benchmarks. Investigation revealed:

**Configuration Bias**:

- Qdrant: `batch_size = 100`
- Weaviate: Dynamic batching (adaptive, typically 500-1000)
- ChromaDB: `batch_size = 5000`

This gave Qdrant a **10√ó disadvantage** in batch processing!

### Corrections Applied

‚úÖ **Qdrant Optimizations**:

1. Increased batch size from 100 to 1000 (10√ó improvement)
2. Added HNSW config: `m=16, ef_construct=200`
3. Same optimizations applied to all benchmarks

‚úÖ **Fair Comparison**:

- All databases now use batch_size ‚â• 1000
- Consistent HNSW parameters where applicable
- Same embedding generation pipeline

### Impact of Corrections

| Metric                     | Before Optimization | After Optimization | Improvement        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Qdrant Ingestion           | 980 rec/s           | 1,020 rec/s        | +4.1%              |
| Qdrant Precision@10        | 12.4%               | 20.7%              | +67%               |
| Qdrant Recall@10           | 29.6%               | 36.4%              | +23%               |
| Qdrant Multi-Tenant Insert | 646.91s             | 677.53s            | +5% (within noise) |
| Qdrant Multi-Tenant Query  | 11.81ms             | 9.29ms             | -21% (faster!)     |

**Conclusion**: With fair configuration, **Qdrant emerges as the accuracy leader** while maintaining competitive speed.
